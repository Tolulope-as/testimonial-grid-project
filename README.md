## My process
The process was short and fast, I examined the design and after that i created the HTML structure, consiting of a parent div nesting 5 individual grid container, i applied styles to change the color ,size and fonts.Then,I used the grid property to create the grid layout using a initial of 4 columns which i later changed to correspond with the design.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned
I was able to practice on CSS grid through the project , i had some obstacles in spanning the rows and columns but overall practicing what i learn will help me retain better.



### Useful resources

- [Kelvin powell's Grid course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - i love the way he explained Grid so simple not confusing and everyone can learn a thing or two from the video.
